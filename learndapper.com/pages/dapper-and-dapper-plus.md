# Is Dapper Plus related to Dapper?

That's a great question!

Some people still debate this, so let's end the debate once and for all.

As the creator of [Dapper Plus](https://dapper-plus.net/), I believe I'm in one of the best positions to answer it.

The answer is...

No and **YES**!

Oh noâ€”now you're probably more confused.

But donâ€™t worry, weâ€™ll explore both answers together.

## NO: Why Dapper Plus is not related to Dapper

Dapper Plus has no dependencies on Dapper.  You can use Dapper Plus without ever using Dapper!

So obviously, that makes Dapper Plus **not related** to Dapper at all.

On my side, Iâ€™ve often considered adding Dapper as a dependencyâ€”but for what exactly?  

I mean, I can already create and handle my own `DbCommand`. Adding Dapper would just bring **a LOT** of unnecessary complexity to the library. And thatâ€™s especially true since we also support EF Core through our [Entity Framework Extensions](https://entityframework-extensions.net/) library, which shares the same core code. It would be like making our codebase more complex just to please a few people... with absolutely **ZERO** benefits.

Now donâ€™t get me wrongâ€”Dapper is amazing.  Iâ€™m one of Dapperâ€™s biggest fans, and I use it in all my own projects, like [ZZZ Code AI](https://zzzcode.ai/).

But using it **inside** Dapper Plus? Bah!

## YES: Why Dapper Plus **IS** related to Dapper

Yes, the two libraries are definitely related!

- âœ… **Sponsorship:** 30% of our revenue goes to sponsoring Dapper. Thatâ€™s $4,500 USD **every month**.
- âœ… **Mindset:** The goal behind Dapper Plus was to follow the same mindset as Dapper by extending `DbConnection`.
- âœ… **Tutorials:** Where do you go when you need Dapper info? [Learn Dapper](https://www.learndapper.com/) and [Dapper Tutorial](https://dappertutorial.net/) â€” both maintained by us.

### ðŸ§¾ Sponsorship

Weâ€™re proud to be a major sponsor of Dapper.

In early 2024, **we** reached out directly to the Dapper team to offer financial support. They didnâ€™t ask us â€” we contacted them.

So yes, Dapper Plus is related to Dapper because we help ensure Dapper stays professionally maintained and developer-supported by sponsorising **$4500 USD** per month.

---

### ðŸ’¡ Mindset

When I created Dapper Plus, I wanted to stick as closely as possible to the same mentality that made Dapper so great.

All our methods extend `DbConnection`, just like Dapper. We even released a free library to extend support to `DbTransaction`: [Dapper.Transaction](https://www.learndapper.com/misc/transaction#dapper-transaction-library)

So yes, Dapper Plus is related to Dapper because it was built with the **same mindset** and the **same spirit**.

### ðŸ“š Tutorials

Letâ€™s be honest â€” Dapper Plus wouldnâ€™t exist without Dapper.

But at the same time, itâ€™s hard to deny that the ecosystem we created around Dapper helped its popularity grow.

Our tutorials help **thousands of developers every month** better understand and use this awesome library.

So yes, Dapper Plus is related to Dapper because it has helped grow the Dapper community through high-quality learning resources.

## Mission

You can read more about our mission here: [ZZZ Projects - Mission](https://zzzprojects.com/mission)

One thing a few people criticize us for is selling our software instead of offering it for free.  But every time I try to hire **them** to work for free... they never accept my offer either, that's strange!

Anyway! Back to our mission â€” making money through our software allows us to support the .NET ecosystem in many ways.  
We sponsor content creators, library maintainers like Dapper, and offer several websites completely free to use, such as:

- [https://dotnetfiddle.net/](https://dotnetfiddle.net/)  
- [https://zzzcode.ai/](https://zzzcode.ai/)  
- [https://sqlfiddle.com/](https://sqlfiddle.com/)

_These websites are free to use, but they cost me **thousands of dollars** every month to keep online!_

In 2025, weâ€™re aiming to give back even more â€” by sponsoring creators and maintainers with over **30% of our total revenue**!

**Why?**  
Iâ€™ll be honest â€” I make enough to live well, and Iâ€™m just happy to share what I can with the amazing people who contribute to the .NET community.

Sure, we could lower our pricesâ€¦  But then, itâ€™s the community that loses â€” because we wouldnâ€™t be able to support them as much.

## Conclusion

The next time someone tells you that Dapper Plus isnâ€™t related to Dapper, just share this article with them.

Thanks to the few libraries we sell â€” like Dapper Plus â€” ZZZ Projects plays a major role in supporting Dapper and the .NET ecosystem as a whole.

And to those who speak negatively about our library or remove the `[Dapper]` tag from [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/dapper-plus), I get it â€” I really do.

But maybe itâ€™s worth reconsidering... 

Because with those small actions, **everyone loses**:

- Dapper loses sponsorship revenue  
- Content creators and other sponsored libraries lose sponsorship revenue  
- And yes, I lose some revenue too

Hey â€” for once, thereâ€™s a company that isnâ€™t too greedy and truly tries to help.

So, if you appreciate what weâ€™re doing...  

A hug is always welcome ðŸ˜‰
