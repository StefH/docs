# Extensions

EF Core has multiple third-party libraries available to enhance your experience.

One of the most notable is [Entity Framework Extensions](https://entityframework-extensions.net/), which we proudly promote on this website—since we’re also the creators!

## Audit.EntityFramework.Core

**Entity Framework Audit Extension for the [Audit.NET library](https://github.com/thepirat000/Audit.NET)**

This extension automatically generates audit logs for your Entity Framework operations. It supports both Entity Framework and Entity Framework Core.

You can use this library to log all interactions with your `DbContext`, including detailed information about each CRUD operation made on your database.
